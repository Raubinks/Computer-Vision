The dataset includes 239 images.
Poker-cards are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 15 percent of the bounding box
